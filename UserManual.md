# DLBench+ User Manual

This is a recap of all points to check while using the DLBench+ benchmark to assess a data lake system. The points are organized following the two mains components of DLBench: 1) The quantitative assessment and 2) the qulitative evaluation.

### Quantitative assessment:
1. The running time considered for each query is the average time of 10 runs. 
2. All timed executions must be warm runs, i.e., the query instance must first be executed once before the assessment starts
3. Caches must be cleaned after each query run


### Qualitative evaluation:

1. The number of users for the qualitative evaluation should be as high as possible.
2. A supervisor must verify that the users correctly execute the assigned tasks when they work in autonomy.
3. The questionnary must be anonymous.
4. It is desirable to vary user profiles to include both business users (having little data management skills) and data management
specialists
